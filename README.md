<!-- About the Project -->

## Motivation

Who doesn't love a quiz! Ultimate Trivia is a web application that was built for a 24 hour hackathon, to build a frontend for an API of choice. It has since been refined.

<!-- TechStack -->

## Tech Stack

### Client

- HTML
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

### Dev

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

## Approach

Originally the application was built with HTML, SASS and vanilla JavaScript. TypeScript was then implemented in order to learn TypeScript with an app with no framework and furthering my understanding on how Webpack works. The application takes a functional approach.

## Deployment

Ultimate Trivia was deployed with GitHub Pages as a static site.

## Enhancements

This project can be enhanced with the following features:

- Record keeping
- Improved UI/UX
